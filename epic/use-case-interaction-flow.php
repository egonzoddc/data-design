		<p align="center">John and Tom are at the bar arguing over who's team is has won more games since they started playing each other.
		John, is a Raiders fan. Tom, is a Broncos fan. The Broncos and Raiders rivalry goes back decades.
		Tom wants to show John that the Broncos have won more games then the Raiders since they started playing each other in 1960.</p>
	<h2 align="center"><strong></strong><font size="6">Interaction Flow:</font></h2>
		<ul align="center">Tom takes out his phone and opens the web browser</ul>
		<ul align="center">Tom enters NFL.com into his web browser</ul>
		<ul align="center">Webstie returns with multiple link options to look at including news, schedule, standings, and records of each team </ul>
		<ul align="center">Tom clicks on the Link that says "Schedule"</ul>
		<ul align="center">Games link returns links for every team in the League</ul>
		<ul align="center">Tom clicks on the "Broncos" link</ul>
		<ul align="center">The link returns the the games the Broncos have played and who they will be playing </ul>
		<ul align="center">Tom clicks on the "Broncos vs. Raiders" link. They played in Week 1 so it is right up top</ul>
		<ul align="center">The link returns the last time they played and the next time they play this season along with a "stats" link</ul>
		<ul align="center">Tom clicks on the "stats" link</ul>
		<ul align="center">Stats link returns all stats of the last game they played and an option for "History" stats</ul>
		<ul align="center">Tom clicks on the "History" link revealing the fact that the teams have played a total of 120 games since 1960. Also showing
									that out of those 120 games the Raiders have won a total of 65 and the Broncos a total of 53 with two games ending in a tie score</ul>
		<ul align="center">Tom is ashamed to show John what he just found out. He was certain the Broncos had the better overall record between the two teams. John
									takes a look at Tom's phone and just starts laughing at Tom and says "See, I told you so!" Now John has even more reason to pick on Tom.
									Thanks technology and NFL.com.</ul>
